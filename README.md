# fictional_entity_generator
**Description**:
A program to generate fictional entities (people, places, organisations, and the connections between them) at random based on user specified parameters against either the default dictionaries of attributes or one passed to the program at runtime.

**Use Cases**:
1. TTRPGs - Rollable table for your DnD stuff - like NPC character descriptors to help with creating people on the fly - “I know I struggle with when I GM is that NPCs feel like NPCs, a bartender is always at the bar, never home with their family or anything else”
2. Brainstorming for writing stories
3. Inclusion as a package in a procedural RPG adventure program
